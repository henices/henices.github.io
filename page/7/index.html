<p>I’ve observed thousands of founders and thought a lot about what it takes to make a huge amount of money or to create something important. Usually, people start off wanting the former and end up wanting the latter.</p>
<p>Here are 13 thoughts about how to achieve such outlier success. Everything here is easier to do once you’ve already reached a baseline degree of success (through privilege or effort) and want to put in the work to turn that into outlier success. [1] But much of it applies to anyone.</p>
<h2 id="1-Compound-yourself"><a href="#1-Compound-yourself" class="headerlink" title="1. Compound yourself"></a>1. Compound yourself</h2><p>Compounding is magic. Look for it everywhere. Exponential curves are the key to wealth generation.</p>
<p>A medium-sized business that grows 50% in value every year becomes huge in a very short amount of time. Few businesses in the world have true network effects and extreme scalability. But with technology, more and more will.  It’s worth a lot of effort to find them and create them.</p>
<p>You also want to be an exponential curve yourself—you should aim for your life to follow an ever-increasing up-and-to-the-right trajectory. It’s important to move towards a career that has a compounding effect—most careers progress fairly linearly.</p>
<p>You don’t want to be in a career where people who have been doing it for two years can be as effective as people who have been doing it for twenty—your rate of learning should always be high. As your career progresses, each unit of work you do should generate more and more results. There are many ways to get this leverage, such as capital, technology, brand, network effects, and managing people.</p>
<p>It’s useful to focus on adding another zero to whatever you define as your success metric—money, status, impact on the world, or whatever. I am willing to take as much time as needed between projects to find my next thing. But I always want it to be a project that, if successful, will make the rest of my career look like a footnote.</p>
<p>Most people get bogged down in linear opportunities. Be willing to let small opportunities go to focus on potential step changes.</p>
<p>I think the biggest competitive advantage in business—either for a company or for an individual’s career—is long-term thinking with a broad view of how different systems in the world are going to come together. One of the notable aspects of compound growth is that the furthest out years are the most important. In a world where almost no one takes a truly long-term view, the market richly rewards those who do.</p>
<p>Trust the exponential, be patient, and be pleasantly surprised.</p>
<h2 id="2-Have-almost-too-much-self-belief"><a href="#2-Have-almost-too-much-self-belief" class="headerlink" title="2. Have almost too much self-belief"></a>2. Have almost too much self-belief</h2><p>Self-belief is immensely powerful. The most successful people I know believe in themselves almost to the point of delusion.</p>
<p>Cultivate this early. As you get more data points that your judgment is good and you can consistently deliver results, trust yourself more.</p>
<p>If you don’t believe in yourself, it’s hard to let yourself have contrarian ideas about the future. But this is where most value gets created.</p>
<p>I remember when Elon Musk took me on a tour of the SpaceX factory many years ago. He talked in detail about manufacturing every part of the rocket, but the thing that sticks in memory was the look of absolute certainty on his face when he talked about sending large rockets to Mars. I left thinking “huh, so that’s the benchmark for what conviction looks like.”</p>
<p>Managing your own morale—and your team’s morale—is one of the greatest challenges of most endeavors. It’s almost impossible without a lot of self-belief. And unfortunately, the more ambitious you are, the more the world will try to tear you down.  </p>
<p>Most highly successful people have been really right about the future at least once at a time when people thought they were wrong. If not, they would have faced much more competition.</p>
<p>Self-belief must be balanced with self-awareness. I used to hate criticism of any sort and actively avoided it. Now I try to always listen to it with the assumption that it’s true, and then decide if I want to act on it or not. Truth-seeking is hard and often painful, but it is what separates self-belief from self-delusion.</p>
<p>This balance also helps you avoid coming across as entitled and out of touch.</p>
<h2 id="3-Learn-to-think-independently"><a href="#3-Learn-to-think-independently" class="headerlink" title="3. Learn to think independently"></a>3. Learn to think independently</h2><p>Entrepreneurship is very difficult to teach because original thinking is very difficult to teach. School is not set up to teach this—in fact, it generally rewards the opposite. So you have to cultivate it on your own.</p>
<p>Thinking from first principles and trying to generate new ideas is fun, and finding people to exchange them with is a great way to get better at this. The next step is to find easy, fast ways to test these ideas in the real world.</p>
<p>“I will fail many times, and I will be really right once” is the entrepreneurs’ way. You have to give yourself a lot of chances to get lucky.</p>
<p>One of the most powerful lessons to learn is that you can figure out what to do in situations that seem to have no solution. The more times you do this, the more you will believe it. Grit comes from learning you can get back up after you get knocked down.</p>
<h2 id="4-Get-good-at-“sales”"><a href="#4-Get-good-at-“sales”" class="headerlink" title="4. Get good at “sales”"></a>4. Get good at “sales”</h2><p>Self-belief alone is not sufficient—you also have to be able to convince other people of what you believe.</p>
<p>All great careers, to some degree, become sales jobs. You have to evangelize your plans to customers, prospective employees, the press, investors, etc. This requires an inspiring vision, strong communication skills, some degree of charisma, and evidence of execution ability.</p>
<p>Getting good at communication—particularly written communication—is an investment worth making. My best advice for communicating clearly is to first make sure your thinking is clear and then use plain, concise language.</p>
<p>The best way to be good at sales is to genuinely believe in what you’re selling. Selling what you truly believe in feels great, and trying to sell snake oil feels awful.</p>
<p>Getting good at sales is like improving at any other skill—anyone can get better at it with deliberate practice. But for some reason, perhaps because it feels distasteful, many people treat it as something unlearnable.</p>
<p>My other big sales tip is to show up in person whenever it’s important. When I was first starting out, I was always willing to get on a plane. It was frequently unnecessary, but three times it led to career-making turning points for me that otherwise would have gone the other way.</p>
<h2 id="5-Make-it-easy-to-take-risks"><a href="#5-Make-it-easy-to-take-risks" class="headerlink" title="5. Make it easy to take risks"></a>5. Make it easy to take risks</h2><p>Most people overestimate risk and underestimate reward. Taking risks is important because it’s impossible to be right all the time—you have to try many things and adapt quickly as you learn more.</p>
<p>It’s often easier to take risks early in your career; you don’t have much to lose, and you potentially have a lot to gain. Once you’ve gotten yourself to a point where you have your basic obligations covered you should try to make it easy to take risks. Look for small bets you can make where you lose 1x if you’re wrong but make 100x if it works. Then make a bigger bet in that direction.</p>
<p>Don’t save up for too long, though. At YC, we’ve often noticed a problem with founders that have spent a lot of time working at Google or Facebook. When people get used to a comfortable life, a predictable job, and a reputation of succeeding at whatever they do, it gets very hard to leave that behind (and people have an incredible ability to always match their lifestyle to next year’s salary). Even if they do leave, the temptation to return is great. It’s easy—and human nature—to prioritize short-term gain and convenience over long-term fulfillment.  </p>
<p>But when you aren’t on the treadmill, you can follow your hunches and spend time on things that might turn out to be really interesting. Keeping your life cheap and flexible for as long as you can is a powerful way to do this, but obviously comes with tradeoffs.</p>
<h2 id="6-Focus"><a href="#6-Focus" class="headerlink" title="6. Focus"></a>6. Focus</h2><p>Focus is a force multiplier on work.</p>
<p>Almost everyone I’ve ever met would be well-served by spending more time thinking about what to focus on. It is much more important to work on the right thing than it is to work many hours. Most people waste most of their time on stuff that doesn’t matter.</p>
<p>Once you have figured out what to do, be unstoppable about getting your small handful of priorities accomplished quickly. I have yet to meet a slow-moving person who is very successful.</p>
<h2 id="7-Work-hard"><a href="#7-Work-hard" class="headerlink" title="7. Work hard"></a>7. Work hard</h2><p>You can get to about the 90th percentile in your field by working either smart or hard, which is still a great accomplishment. But getting to the 99th percentile requires both—you will be competing with other very talented people who will have great ideas and be willing to work a lot.</p>
<p>Extreme people get extreme results. Working a lot comes with huge life trade-offs, and it’s perfectly rational to decide not to do it. But it has a lot of advantages. As in most cases, momentum compounds, and success begets success.</p>
<p>And it’s often really fun. One of the great joys in life is finding your purpose, excelling at it, and discovering that your impact matters to something larger than yourself. A YC founder recently expressed great surprise about how much happier and more fulfilled he was after leaving his job at a big company and working towards his maximum possible impact. Working hard at that should be celebrated.  </p>
<p>It’s not entirely clear to me why working hard has become a Bad Thing in certain parts of the US, but this is certainly not the case in other parts of the world—the amount of energy and drive exhibited by entrepreneurs outside of the US is quickly becoming the new benchmark.</p>
<p>You have to figure out how to work hard without burning out. People find their own strategies for this, but one that almost always works is to find work you like doing with people you enjoy spending a lot of time with.</p>
<p>I think people who pretend you can be super successful professionally without working most of the time (for some period of your life) are doing a disservice. In fact, work stamina seems to be one of the biggest predictors of long-term success.</p>
<p>One more thought about working hard: do it at the beginning of your career. Hard work compounds like interest, and the earlier you do it, the more time you have for the benefits to pay off. It’s also easier to work hard when you have fewer other responsibilities, which is frequently but not always the case when you’re young.</p>
<h2 id="8-Be-bold"><a href="#8-Be-bold" class="headerlink" title="8. Be bold"></a>8. Be bold</h2><p>I believe that it’s easier to do a hard startup than an easy startup. People want to be part of something exciting and feel that their work matters.</p>
<p>If you are making progress on an important problem, you will have a constant tailwind of people wanting to help you. Let yourself grow more ambitious, and don’t be afraid to work on what you really want to work on.</p>
<p>If everyone else is starting meme companies, and you want to start a gene-editing company, then do that and don’t second guess it.</p>
<p>Follow your curiosity. Things that seem exciting to you will often seem exciting to other people too.</p>
<h2 id="9-Be-willful"><a href="#9-Be-willful" class="headerlink" title="9. Be willful"></a>9. Be willful</h2><p>A big secret is that you can bend the world to your will a surprising percentage of the time—most people don’t even try, and just accept that things are the way that they are.</p>
<p>People have an enormous capacity to make things happen. A combination of self-doubt, giving up too early, and not pushing hard enough prevents most people from ever reaching anywhere near their potential.</p>
<p>Ask for what you want. You usually won’t get it, and often the rejection will be painful. But when this works, it works surprisingly well.</p>
<p>Almost always, the people who say “I am going to keep going until this works, and no matter what the challenges are I’m going to figure them out”, and mean it, go on to succeed. They are persistent long enough to give themselves a chance for luck to go their way.</p>
<p>Airbnb is my benchmark for this. There are so many stories they tell that I wouldn’t recommend trying to reproduce (keeping maxed-out credit cards in those nine-slot three-ring binder pages kids use for baseball cards, eating dollar store cereal for every meal, battle after battle with powerful entrenched interest, and on and on) but they managed to survive long enough for luck to go their way.</p>
<p>To be willful, you have to be optimistic—hopefully this is a personality trait that can be improved with practice. I have never met a very successful pessimistic person.</p>
<h2 id="10-Be-hard-to-compete-with"><a href="#10-Be-hard-to-compete-with" class="headerlink" title="10. Be hard to compete with"></a>10. Be hard to compete with</h2><p>Most people understand that companies are more valuable if they are difficult to compete with. This is important, and obviously true.</p>
<p>But this holds true for you as an individual as well. If what you do can be done by someone else, it eventually will be, and for less money.</p>
<p>The best way to become difficult to compete with is to build up leverage. For example, you can do it with personal relationships, by building a strong personal brand, or by getting good at the intersection of multiple different fields. There are many other strategies, but you have to figure out some way to do it.</p>
<p>Most people do whatever most people they hang out with do. This mimetic behavior is usually a mistake—if you’re doing the same thing everyone else is doing, you will not be hard to compete with.</p>
<h2 id="11-Build-a-network"><a href="#11-Build-a-network" class="headerlink" title="11. Build a network"></a>11. Build a network</h2><p>Great work requires teams. Developing a network of talented people to work with—sometimes closely, sometimes loosely—is an essential part of a great career. The size of the network of really talented people you know often becomes the limiter for what you can accomplish.</p>
<p>An effective way to build a network is to help people as much as you can. Doing this, over a long period of time, is what lead to most of my best career opportunities and three of my four best investments. I’m continually surprised how often something good happens to me because of something I did to help a founder ten years ago.</p>
<p>One of the best ways to build a network is to develop a reputation for really taking care of the people who work with you. Be overly generous with sharing the upside; it will come back to you 10x. Also, learn how to evaluate what people are great at, and put them in those roles. (This is the most important thing I have learned about management, and I haven’t read much about it.) You want to have a reputation for pushing people hard enough that they accomplish more than they thought they could, but not so hard they burn out.</p>
<p>Everyone is better at some things than others. Define yourself by your strengths, not your weaknesses. Acknowledge your weaknesses and figure out how to work around them, but don’t let them stop you from doing what you want to do. “I can’t do X because I’m not good at Y” is something I hear from entrepreneurs surprisingly often, and almost always reflects a lack of creativity. The best way to make up for your weaknesses is to hire complementary team members instead of just hiring people who are good at the same things you are.</p>
<p>A particularly valuable part of building a network is to get good at discovering undiscovered talent. Quickly spotting intelligence, drive, and creativity gets much easier with practice. The easiest way to learn is just to meet a lot of people, and keep track of who goes on to impress you and who doesn’t. Remember that you are mostly looking for rate of improvement, and don’t overvalue experience or current accomplishment.</p>
<p>I try to always ask myself when I meet someone new “is this person a force of nature?” It’s a pretty good heuristic for finding people who are likely to accomplish great things.</p>
<p>A special case of developing a network is finding someone eminent to take a bet on you, ideally early in your career. The best way to do this, no surprise, is to go out of your way to be helpful. (And remember that you have to pay this forward at some point later!)</p>
<p>Finally, remember to spend your time with positive people who support your ambitions.</p>
<h2 id="12-You-get-rich-by-owning-things"><a href="#12-You-get-rich-by-owning-things" class="headerlink" title="12. You get rich by owning things"></a>12. You get rich by owning things</h2><p>The biggest economic misunderstanding of my childhood was that people got rich from high salaries. Though there are some exceptions—entertainers for example —almost no one in the history of the Forbes list has gotten there with a salary.</p>
<p>You get truly rich by owning things that increase rapidly in value.</p>
<p>This can be a piece of a business, real estate, natural resource, intellectual property, or other similar things. But somehow or other, you need to own equity in something, instead of just selling your time. Time only scales linearly.</p>
<p>The best way to make things that increase rapidly in value is by making things people want at scale.</p>
<h2 id="13-Be-internally-driven"><a href="#13-Be-internally-driven" class="headerlink" title="13. Be internally driven"></a>13. Be internally driven</h2><p>Most people are primarily externally driven; they do what they do because they want to impress other people. This is bad for many reasons, but here are two important ones.</p>
<p>First, you will work on consensus ideas and on consensus career tracks.  You will care a lot—much more than you realize—if other people think you’re doing the right thing. This will probably prevent you from doing truly interesting work, and even if you do, someone else would have done it anyway.</p>
<p>Second, you will usually get risk calculations wrong. You’ll be very focused on keeping up with other people and not falling behind in competitive games, even in the short term.</p>
<p>Smart people seem to be especially at risk of such externally-driven behavior. Being aware of it helps, but only a little—you will likely have to work super-hard to not fall in the mimetic trap.</p>
<p>The most successful people I know are primarily internally driven; they do what they do to impress themselves and because they feel compelled to make something happen in the world. After you’ve made enough money to buy whatever you want and gotten enough social status that it stops being fun to get more, this is the only force I know of that will continue to drive you to higher levels of performance.</p>
<p>This is why the question of a person’s motivation is so important. It’s the first thing I try to understand about someone. The right motivations are hard to define a set of rules for, but you know it when you see it.</p>
<p>Jessica Livingston and Paul Graham are my benchmarks for this. YC was widely mocked for the first few years, and almost no one thought it would be a big success when they first started. But they thought it would be great for the world if it worked, and they love helping people, and they were convinced their new model was better than the existing model.</p>
<p>Eventually, you will define your success by performing excellent work in areas that are important to you. The sooner you can start off in that direction, the further you will be able to go. It is hard to be wildly successful at anything you aren’t obsessed with.</p>
<h2 id="1-A-comment-response-I-wrote-on-HN"><a href="#1-A-comment-response-I-wrote-on-HN" class="headerlink" title="[1] A comment response I wrote on HN:"></a>[1] A comment response I wrote on HN:</h2><p>One of the biggest reasons I’m excited about basic income is the amount of human potential it will unleash by freeing more people to take risks.<br>Until then, if you aren’t born lucky, you have to claw your way up for awhile before you can take big swings. If you are born in extreme poverty, then this is super difficult :(</p>
<p>It is obviously an incredible shame and waste that opportunity is so unevenly distributed. But I’ve witnessed enough people be born with the deck stacked badly against them and go on to incredible success to know it’s possible.</p>
<p>I am deeply aware of the fact that I personally would not be where I am if I weren’t born incredibly lucky.</p>

<h2 id="以下是-DeepL-的翻译"><a href="#以下是-DeepL-的翻译" class="headerlink" title="以下是 DeepL 的翻译"></a>以下是 DeepL 的翻译</h2><p>标题： 如何获得成功</p>
<p>我观察了数以千计的创始人，并思考了很多关于赚取巨额金钱或创造重要事物所需的东西。通常情况下，人们一开始希望得到前者，最后却希望得到后者。</p>
<p>这里有13个关于如何实现这种超常成功的想法。一旦你已经达到了成功的基本程度（通过特权或努力），并想投入工作将其转化为离群的成功，这里的一切就更容易做到。[1] 但其中大部分内容适用于任何人。</p>
<h2 id="1-复利自己"><a href="#1-复利自己" class="headerlink" title="1. 复利自己"></a>1. 复利自己</h2><p>复利是一种魔法。到处寻找它。指数曲线是创造财富的关键。</p>
<p>一个中等规模的企业，如果每年的价值增长50%，就会在很短的时间内变得巨大。世界上很少有企业拥有真正的网络效应和极端的可扩展性。但随着技术的发展，会有越来越多的企业。 值得花大力气去寻找它们，创造它们。</p>
<p>你也想让自己成为一条指数曲线–你的目标应该是让你的生活遵循一条不断增加的向上和向右的轨迹。重要的是，要朝着具有复合效应的职业发展–大多数职业的发展是相当线性的。</p>
<p>你不希望在一个职业中，做了两年的人可以和做了二十年的人一样有效–你的学习率应该一直很高。随着你事业的发展，你所做的每一个单位的工作应该产生越来越多的结果。有很多方法可以获得这种杠杆作用，如资本、技术、品牌、网络效应和管理人。</p>
<p>不管你把什么定义为你的成功指标–金钱、地位、对世界的影响，或者其他什么，专注于再加一个零是很有用的。我愿意在项目之间花尽可能多的时间来寻找我的下一件事。但我总是希望它是一个项目，如果成功，将使我职业生涯的其余部分看起来像一个脚注。</p>
<p>大多数人在线性机会中陷入困境。要愿意让小的机会消失，以专注于潜在的步骤变化。</p>
<p>我认为商业上最大的竞争优势–无论是对公司还是对个人的职业生涯–是长期的思考，对世界上不同的系统如何结合起来有一个广泛的看法。复合增长的一个显著方面是，最远的年份是最重要的。在这个世界上，几乎没有人采取真正的长期观点，市场对那些这样做的人给予了丰厚的回报。</p>
<p>相信指数，要有耐心，并获得惊喜。</p>
<h2 id="2-拥有几乎太多的自信心"><a href="#2-拥有几乎太多的自信心" class="headerlink" title="2. 拥有几乎太多的自信心"></a>2. 拥有几乎太多的自信心</h2><p>自信的力量是巨大的。我认识的最成功的人对自己的信念几乎达到了妄想的程度。</p>
<p>尽早培养这种信念。当你得到更多的数据，证明你的判断力是好的，而且你能持续提供结果时，就更加相信自己。</p>
<p>如果你不相信自己，就很难让自己对未来有逆向的想法。但这是最能创造价值的地方。</p>
<p>我记得很多年前，埃隆-马斯克带我参观了SpaceX的工厂。他详细谈论了火箭的每一个部分的制造，但让我记忆犹新的是，当他谈到将大型火箭送往火星时，他脸上露出了绝对肯定的表情。我离开时想：”啊，原来这就是信念的基准。”</p>
<p>管理你自己的士气–以及你的团队的士气–是大多数工作的最大挑战之一。如果没有足够的自信心，这几乎是不可能的。不幸的是，你越有雄心壮志，世界就越想把你打倒。 </p>
<p>大多数高度成功的人至少有一次在人们认为他们错了的时候，对未来的看法是真正正确的。如果不是这样，他们会面临更多的竞争。</p>
<p>自信必须与自我意识相平衡。我曾经讨厌任何形式的批评，并主动回避它。现在，我试着总是在假设它是真实的情况下听取它，然后决定是否要采取行动。寻求真理是困难的，而且常常是痛苦的，但它是区分自信心和自欺欺人的原因。</p>
<p>这种平衡也有助于你避免表现出有权和不合群的样子。</p>
<h2 id="3-学会独立思考"><a href="#3-学会独立思考" class="headerlink" title="3. 学会独立思考"></a>3. 学会独立思考</h2><p>创业精神是很难教的，因为原创性思维是很难教的。学校的设置不是为了教这个–事实上，它通常奖励相反的东西。所以你必须自己培养它。</p>
<p>从第一原则出发思考并试图产生新的想法是很有趣的，而找到与之交流的人是在这方面做得更好的一个好方法。下一步是找到简单、快速的方法，在现实世界中测试这些想法。</p>
<p>“我会失败很多次，而我真的会对一次 “是企业家的方式。你必须给自己很多机会来获得幸运。</p>
<p>要学习的最有力的课程之一是，你可以在似乎没有解决方案的情况下想出办法。你这样做的次数越多，你就会越相信它。勇气来自于学习你可以在被击倒后重新站起来。</p>
<h2 id="4-善于-“销售”"><a href="#4-善于-“销售”" class="headerlink" title="4. 善于 “销售”"></a>4. 善于 “销售”</h2><p>光有自信心是不够的，你还必须能够说服其他人相信你的想法。</p>
<p>所有伟大的事业，在某种程度上，都成为销售工作。你必须向客户、未来的员工、媒体、投资者等宣扬你的计划。这需要一个鼓舞人心的愿景，强大的沟通技巧，一定程度的魅力，以及执行能力的证明。</p>
<p>善于沟通，特别是书面沟通，是一项值得投资的工作。我对清晰沟通的最佳建议是，首先确保你的思路清晰，然后使用平实、简明的语言。</p>
<p>做好销售的最好方法是真正相信你所销售的东西。销售你真正相信的东西感觉很好，而试图销售蛇油的感觉很糟糕。</p>
<p>擅长销售就像提高其他技能一样，任何人都可以通过刻意练习而变得更好。但出于某种原因，也许是因为它让人感到厌恶，许多人把它当作无法学习的东西。</p>
<p>我的另一个重要的销售建议是在重要的时候亲自出面。当我刚开始工作时，我总是愿意坐飞机。这经常是不必要的，但有三次它导致了我的职业生涯的转折点，否则就会走到另一个方向。</p>
<h2 id="5-让人容易承担风险"><a href="#5-让人容易承担风险" class="headerlink" title="5.让人容易承担风险"></a>5.让人容易承担风险</h2><p>大多数人高估了风险，低估了回报。承担风险是很重要的，因为你不可能一直都是正确的，你必须尝试很多东西，并在你学到更多东西时迅速适应。</p>
<p>在你职业生涯的早期，往往更容易承担风险；你没有什么损失，而你有可能获得很多。一旦你让自己的基本义务得到保障，你就应该试着让自己容易承担风险。寻找你可以做的小赌注，如果你错了，你会损失1倍，但如果成功了，会赚100倍。然后朝着这个方向做一个更大的赌注。</p>
<p>不过，不要积攒太久。在YC，我们经常注意到那些在谷歌或Facebook工作了很长时间的创始人的一个问题。当人们习惯了舒适的生活，可预测的工作，以及无论做什么都能成功的声誉时，就很难将其抛在脑后（人们有一种难以置信的能力，总是将自己的生活方式与明年的工资相匹配）。即使他们真的离开了，返回的诱惑也很大。将短期利益和便利性置于长期成就之上是很容易的，也是人类的天性。 </p>
<p>但是，当你不在跑步机上时，你可以跟随你的直觉，把时间花在那些可能变成真正有趣的事情上。在尽可能长的时间内保持你的生活廉价和灵活是一个强大的方法，但显然是有代价的。</p>
<h2 id="6-专注"><a href="#6-专注" class="headerlink" title="6. 专注"></a>6. 专注</h2><p>专注是工作中的一种力量倍增器。</p>
<p>我见过的几乎每个人都会花更多的时间来思考该专注于什么。在正确的事情上工作比在许多时间上工作要重要得多。大多数人把大部分时间浪费在不重要的事情上。</p>
<p>一旦你想清楚了要做什么，就要势不可挡地迅速完成你那一小撮优先事项。我还没有见过一个行动缓慢的人非常成功。</p>
<h2 id="7-努力工作"><a href="#7-努力工作" class="headerlink" title="7. 努力工作"></a>7. 努力工作</h2><p>你可以通过聪明或努力工作达到你所在领域的第90个百分点，这仍然是一个伟大的成就。但是，要想达到第99百分位数，则需要两者兼备–你将与其他非常有才华的人竞争，他们会有很好的想法，并愿意付出很多努力。</p>
<p>极端的人得到极端的结果。大量工作伴随着巨大的生活权衡，决定不这样做是完全理性的。但它也有很多优点。就像在大多数情况下一样，势头会越来越大，成功会带来成功。</p>
<p>而且它往往非常有趣。生活中最大的乐趣之一是找到你的目的，在这方面表现出色，并发现你的影响比你自己更重要。一位YC的创始人最近表示非常惊讶，在离开大公司的工作后，他变得更加快乐和充实，并为自己的最大影响力而努力。在这一点上努力工作应该得到赞许。 </p>
<p>我并不完全清楚为什么在美国的某些地方，努力工作已经成为一件坏事，但在世界其他地方肯定不是这样的–美国以外的企业家所表现出来的能量和动力正迅速成为新的基准。</p>
<p>你必须弄清楚如何努力工作而不至于筋疲力尽。人们为此找到自己的策略，但有一个几乎总是有效的策略是找到你喜欢的工作，与你喜欢花很多时间的人一起工作。</p>
<p>我认为那些假装你可以在职业上取得巨大成功而不需要大部分时间（在你生命中的某个时期）工作的人是在做一件坏事。事实上，工作耐力似乎是长期成功的最大预测因素之一。</p>
<p>关于努力工作还有一个想法：在你的职业生涯开始时就努力工作。艰苦的工作就像利息一样复利，你越早做，你就有越多的时间来获得回报。当你有较少的其他责任时，也更容易努力工作，这在你年轻的时候经常发生，但并不总是这样。</p>
<h2 id="8-大胆一点"><a href="#8-大胆一点" class="headerlink" title="8. 大胆一点"></a>8. 大胆一点</h2><p>我相信，做一个艰难的创业公司比做一个容易的创业公司更容易。人们希望成为令人兴奋的事情的一部分，并感到他们的工作很重要。</p>
<p>如果你在一个重要的问题上取得了进展，你将会有一个持续的尾巴，人们想要帮助你。让自己变得更有野心，不要害怕从事你真正想做的工作。</p>
<p>如果其他人都在创办备忘录公司，而你想创办一家基因编辑公司，那就去做，不要猜测。</p>
<p>遵循你的好奇心。对你来说似乎很兴奋的事情，往往也会让其他人感到兴奋。</p>
<h2 id="9-要有意志力"><a href="#9-要有意志力" class="headerlink" title="9.要有意志力"></a>9.要有意志力</h2><p>一个很大的秘密是，你可以在令人惊讶的时间内使世界屈服于你的意志，大多数人甚至没有尝试，而只是接受事情是他们的方式。</p>
<p>人们有一种巨大的能力来使事情发生。自我怀疑、过早放弃和不够努力等因素结合在一起，使大多数人无法达到接近其潜力的程度。</p>
<p>要求得到你想要的东西。你通常不会得到它，而且往往拒绝会很痛苦。但当这一方法奏效时，它的效果出奇地好。</p>
<p>几乎总是这样，那些说 “我要一直走下去，直到成功为止，不管有什么挑战，我都要把它们解决掉 “的人，并且是认真的，会继续取得成功。他们坚持了足够长的时间，给自己一个机会，让幸运降临到他们身上。</p>
<p>Airbnb是我在这方面的基准。他们有很多故事，我不建议尝试复制（把刷爆的信用卡放在孩子们用来装棒球卡的九槽三环夹子里，每顿都吃一元店的麦片，与强大的利益集团进行一场又一场的斗争，等等），但他们设法生存了足够长的时间，让运气顺着他们。</p>
<p>要想成为有意志力的人，你必须要乐观–希望这是一个可以通过实践来改善的人格特质。我从未见过一个非常成功的悲观主义者。</p>
<h2 id="10-很难与之竞争"><a href="#10-很难与之竞争" class="headerlink" title="10. 很难与之竞争"></a>10. 很难与之竞争</h2><p>大多数人都明白，如果公司难以与之竞争，就更有价值。这很重要，显然也是事实。</p>
<p>但这对作为个人的你也是如此。如果你所做的事情可以由别人来做，那么最终就会由别人来做，而且花的钱更少。</p>
<p>变得难以与之竞争的最好方法是建立杠杆。例如，你可以通过个人关系，通过建立一个强大的个人品牌，或者通过在多个不同领域的交叉点上获得优势来做到这一点。还有许多其他策略，但你必须想出一些办法来做。</p>
<p>大多数人做他们所交往的大多数人做的事。这种模仿行为通常是个错误–如果你做的是别人都在做的事情，你将不难与之竞争。</p>
<h2 id="11-建立一个网络"><a href="#11-建立一个网络" class="headerlink" title="11. 建立一个网络"></a>11. 建立一个网络</h2><p>伟大的工作需要团队。发展一个由有才华的人组成的工作网络–有时是紧密的，有时是松散的–是伟大事业的一个重要组成部分。你所认识的真正有才华的人的网络的大小往往成为你能取得成就的限制因素。</p>
<p>建立网络的一个有效方法是尽可能地帮助别人。在很长一段时间内，这样做是导致我最好的职业机会和我四个最好的投资中的三个的原因。我不断感到惊讶，因为我十年前帮助一位创始人的事情，经常有好事发生在我身上。</p>
<p>建立网络的最好方法之一是建立一个真正照顾到与你合作的人的声誉。要过分慷慨地分享好处；这将会给你带来10倍的回报。另外，学会如何评估人们的长处，并让他们担任这些职务。(这是我在管理方面学到的最重要的东西，而我并没有读过很多这方面的书）。你要有一个口碑，那就是把人逼得够狠，使他们的成就超过他们的想象，但又不至于让他们倦怠。</p>
<p>每个人在某些方面都比其他人强。用你的优势来定义你自己，而不是你的弱点。承认你的弱点并想办法解决它们，但不要让它们阻止你做你想做的事。”我不能做X，因为我不擅长Y”，这是我经常从企业家那里听到的，而且几乎总是反映出缺乏创造力。弥补你的弱点的最好方法是雇用互补的团队成员，而不是仅仅雇用那些擅长你所做的同样事情的人。</p>
<p>建立网络的一个特别有价值的部分是要善于发现未被发现的人才。通过练习，快速发现智慧、动力和创造力变得更加容易。最简单的学习方法就是认识很多人，并跟踪谁会给你留下深刻印象，谁不会。记住，你主要是在寻找改进的速度，不要高估经验或当前的成就。</p>
<p>当我遇到新的人时，我试着总是问自己：”这个人是一个自然的力量吗？” 这是一个相当好的启发式方法，可以找到那些有可能完成伟大事业的人。</p>
<p>发展网络的一个特殊情况是找到知名人士为你下注，最好是在你职业生涯的早期。要做到这一点，毫不奇怪，最好的办法是不遗余力地提供帮助。(请记住，你必须在以后的某个时间点上把这些钱交出来！）。</p>
<p>最后，记得把你的时间花在支持你雄心壮志的积极人士身上。</p>
<h2 id="12-你通过拥有东西而致富"><a href="#12-你通过拥有东西而致富" class="headerlink" title="12. 你通过拥有东西而致富"></a>12. 你通过拥有东西而致富</h2><p>我童年时最大的经济误区是人们通过高薪致富。虽然有一些例外–例如娱乐界人士–但在福布斯榜单的历史上，几乎没有人是靠工资获得的。</p>
<p>你通过拥有快速增值的东西来获得真正的财富。</p>
<p>这可以是一个企业的一部分，房地产，自然资源，知识产权，或其他类似的东西。但无论如何，你需要拥有某些东西的股权，而不是仅仅出售你的时间。时间只是线性扩展的。</p>
<p>制造快速增值的东西的最好方法是大规模制造人们想要的东西。</p>
<h2 id="13-要有内部驱动力"><a href="#13-要有内部驱动力" class="headerlink" title="13. 要有内部驱动力"></a>13. 要有内部驱动力</h2><p>大多数人主要是受外部驱动；他们做他们所做的事是因为他们想给其他人留下深刻印象。这有很多不好的原因，但这里有两个重要的原因。</p>
<p>首先，你将在协商一致的想法和协商一致的职业轨道上工作。 你会非常关心–比你意识到的要多得多–其他人是否认为你在做正确的事情。这可能会阻止你做真正有趣的工作，即使你做了，别人也会做。</p>
<p>第二，你通常会把风险计算弄错。你会非常专注于跟上别人的步伐，在竞争性游戏中不掉队，即使是在短期内。</p>
<p>聪明人似乎特别容易出现这种外在驱动的行为。意识到这一点有帮助，但只是一点点–你很可能要付出超强的努力才不会落入模仿的陷阱。</p>
<p>我所知道的最成功的人主要是由内部驱动的；他们所做的事情是为了给自己留下深刻印象，也是因为他们感到有必要在这个世界上有所作为。在你赚够了钱，可以买到你想要的任何东西，得到了足够的社会地位，不再以获得更多的东西为乐趣之后，这是我所知道的唯一的力量，会继续推动你达到更高的表现水平。</p>
<p>这就是为什么一个人的动机问题是如此重要。这是我试图了解一个人的第一件事。正确的动机很难定义一套规则，但当你看到它时，你就会知道它。</p>
<p>杰西卡-利文斯顿和保罗-格雷厄姆是我这方面的标杆。YC在最初几年被广泛嘲笑，在他们刚开始的时候几乎没有人认为它会大获成功。但他们认为，如果它能成功，对世界来说是件好事，而且他们喜欢帮助人，他们坚信他们的新模式比现有模式更好。</p>
<p>最终，你将通过在对你很重要的领域进行出色的工作来定义你的成功。你越早朝这个方向起步，你就能走得越远。你很难在你不痴迷的事情上取得巨大的成功。</p>
<h2 id="1-我在HN上写的一个评论回应。"><a href="#1-我在HN上写的一个评论回应。" class="headerlink" title="[1] 我在HN上写的一个评论回应。"></a>[1] 我在HN上写的一个评论回应。</h2><p>我对基本收入感到兴奋的最大原因之一是，它将通过释放更多的人去冒险而释放出大量的人类潜力。<br>在此之前，如果你不是天生的幸运儿，你必须在大摇大摆之前努力奋斗一阵子。如果你出生在极端贫困地区，那么这就超级困难了。</p>
<p>机会分配如此不均，显然是一种难以置信的耻辱和浪费。但是，我已经目睹了足够多的人出生在对他们非常不利的环境中，并取得了令人难以置信的成功，所以我知道这是可能的。</p>
<p>我深深地意识到，如果我不是生来就非常幸运，我个人就不会有现在的成就。</p>

<ul>
<li>投资最重要的要少犯错</li>
<li>虽然没法预测股票走势，但是股票价格的高低还是需要清楚的，虽然价格低的可能继续走低，价格高的可能继续走高</li>
<li>投机和投资没有本质区别，投机的「机」是择时，价值投资也是择时，市场上的股票供需关系会影响价格</li>
<li>需要知道市场周期，牛熊轮回，不同的市场时期，选择的投资策略也不同</li>
<li>做3到5年的长线投资，关注市场的主线，在龙头股上赚大钱</li>
<li>注重风险管理，投资前测算最差情况，只在有把握时下注，平时不太看盘</li>
<li>使用资产配置来分摊风险，房地产、债券、股票等均有涉猎</li>
<li>每个人都有自己擅长的标的(能力圈)，林园的投资主线是和吃的有关系的消费股</li>
</ul>
<p>这篇采访出了个彩蛋🎉，主持人问林园平日都有啥爱好。林园说他有两个爱好：1. 逛夜总会 2. 走长路<br>林园逛夜总会的段子已经广泛流传，主持人也接不住这话茬 ：）认真分析 逛夜总会是看高端消费，走长路是看日常消费。<br>一般成功的投资人都有自己独特的指标。</p>
</div></article></div><div class="card"><article class="card-content article" role="article"><div class="article-meta is-size-7 is-uppercase level is-mobile"><div class="level-left"><span class="level-item">Posted&nbsp;<time dateTime="2022-10-07T16:00:00.000Z" title="2022/10/8 00:00:00">2022-10-08</time></span><span class="level-item">Updated&nbsp;<time dateTime="2022-10-08T16:00:00.000Z" title="2022/10/9 00:00:00">2022-10-09</time></span></div></div><p class="title is-3 is-size-4-mobile"><a class="link-muted" href="/cn/logseq3/">Logseq 使用小结 （三）</a></p><div class="content"><p>使用 Logseq 写笔记已经大半年了，Logseq 是这么多年来除了 vim 之外，唯一可以在使用上螺旋上升的软件。我把 Logseq 推荐给媳妇，她用来写会议纪要，写备忘录，管理待办事项，也用得挺好。</p>
<p>Logseq 的成功之处在于它降低了记录的成本，不需要大段大段的文字，也不需要太多的文章结构，随时都可以记录。Logseq 比较严重的问题是它的使用太灵活了，前后记录的标准、格式、标签等要素可能不一致，容易造成笔记凌乱。笔记一凌乱就没法有效的聚合，笔记的有效聚合形成一个有意义的想法群是 Logseq 等双链软件和其他笔记软件相比最有价值的地方。</p>
<p>我这半年来总结出笔记系统成功的关键是： 在同一个地方，用同样的格式和一致的标准记录你的洞见。但是由于 Logseq 缺乏有效的工作流，没法自动化提示必要的步骤，只能通过不断的练习来强化学习。另外 Logseq 中 page 和 tag 只是起到过滤笔记的作用，最关键的笔记之间的链接却很容易被忽视，tag 的数量一多又会开始笔记凌乱了。</p>
<p>总而言之，如果只是把 Logseq 作为备忘，或者简单作为信息记录，挺好用也不需要学习太多的东西，但是如果需要使用 Logseq 来实践卡片笔记法等 PKM 理论，恐怕还是需要花费一些功夫仔细琢磨一番。PKM 方面的书籍我强力推荐 《卡片笔记写作法》一书，中文翻译很不错，虽然书名是谈写作，里面的内容却涉及很广，我自己阅读后收益良多。</p>
<p>就实践卡片笔记法来说，浮墨是一个比较理想的工具，「少即是多，多则惑」，去掉一切不需要的功能，重点才能突出。Logseq 的野心挺大，不想只做一个双链笔记本，还想做得更多，这就要求我们想清楚使用其的主要目的是什么。现实中并不存在一个 all in one 的理想工具，什么工具合适就可以使用什么工具，各位施主不能 「着相」了。</p>
<p>上面说的是一些「道」层面的东西， Logseq 在「术」方面的东西也不少，下面将介绍一些前两篇尚未涉及的功能和使用技巧。</p>
<h2 id="☆-使用-properties"><a href="#☆-使用-properties" class="headerlink" title="☆ 使用 properties"></a>☆ 使用 properties</h2><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.logseq.com/#/page/term%2Fproperties">https://docs.logseq.com/#/page/term%2Fproperties</a></p>
<p>在 Logseq 中有两种 properties， page properties 和 block properties。</p>
<ul>
<li>Page properties 在第一个 block 写 <code>property:: value</code>  </li>
<li>Block properties 在每个 block 内使用 <code>property:: value</code></li>
</ul>
<p>在使用 block properties 时，需要输入 <code>shift + Enter</code> 来进行换行，换行后输入 <code>::</code> Logseq 会自动提示已经使用过的 property。理解 properties 可以简单的把 block 看成数据库的一条记录， properties 就是不同的字段，可以通过 Logseq 的 query 来查询相关记录。在使用 properties 时可以引用 page 或者 tag，可以通过这种方法来索引这条记录。</p>
<p>例如，我将书籍的 block 都添加了 <code>category:: Books</code> 的属性，后续可以使用 <code>&#123;&#123;query (property category Books) &#125;&#125;</code> 来查询所有书籍了，感觉上有点类似 notion 的表格。</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/henices/pictures/raw/master/logseq3_1.png"></p>
<h2 id="☆-使用-Scheduled-制定计划"><a href="#☆-使用-Scheduled-制定计划" class="headerlink" title="☆ 使用 &#x2F;Scheduled 制定计划"></a>☆ 使用 &#x2F;Scheduled 制定计划</h2><p>使用 Schedule 的功能的方法比较简单，在写完一条 block 后，输入 <code>shift + enter </code> 换行后，输入 <code>/Scheduled</code> 在弹出的界面中选择时间周期即可。</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/henices/pictures/raw/master/logseq3_2.png"></p>
<p>在 Schedule 规定的时间内，Logseq 的 Journals 页面可以看到相关的内容。</p>
<h2 id="☆-使用模板-（Template）"><a href="#☆-使用模板-（Template）" class="headerlink" title="☆ 使用模板 （Template）"></a>☆ 使用模板 （Template）</h2><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.logseq.com/#/page/templates">https://docs.logseq.com/#/page/templates</a></p>
<p>使用模板的好处是可以避免重复性的劳动，比如你希望在 Journals 页面里按照 [[每日工作]] [[每日心得]] 的固定格式来记录，那么你需要在每天重复输入一次。但如果你制作一个固定模板，就可以使用 <code>/Template</code> 命令来完成自动化的输入。</p>
<p>制作模板的过程可以参考 Logseq 官方的动画，简单说就是写一个 block，这个 block 包含了必要的结构，在 block 前面的圆点点击鼠标右键 -&gt; Make template，再输入模板的名字就完成了。在后续的使用过程中，输入 <code>/Template</code> 后在弹出的界面选择对应的模板名就可以完成自动化的输入。</p>
<h2 id="☆-一些好用的插件"><a href="#☆-一些好用的插件" class="headerlink" title="☆ 一些好用的插件"></a>☆ 一些好用的插件</h2><p>插件可以拓展 Logseq 的功能，使用插件的方法在 <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.usmacd.com/2022/03/07/logseq2/">Logseq 使用小结 （二）</a> 中有详细介绍，这里就不再细说。</p>
<h3 id="Logseq-Plugin-Tabs"><a href="#Logseq-Plugin-Tabs" class="headerlink" title="Logseq Plugin Tabs"></a>Logseq Plugin Tabs</h3><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/pengx17/logseq-plugin-tabs">https://github.com/pengx17/logseq-plugin-tabs</a></p>
<p>Plugin Tabs 像打开浏览器一样打开 pages 或者 blocks，对于内容比较多的 page，这个插件非常实用。</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/henices/pictures/raw/master/logseq3_4.png"></p>
<h3 id="logseq-plugin-mark-map"><a href="#logseq-plugin-mark-map" class="headerlink" title="logseq-plugin-mark-map"></a>logseq-plugin-mark-map</h3><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/vipzhicheng/logseq-plugin-mark-map">https://github.com/vipzhicheng/logseq-plugin-mark-map</a></p>
<p>Mark map 可以自动化地把你的笔记用导图的形式输出，方便展示和记忆。</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/henices/pictures/raw/master/logseq3_5.png"></p>
<h2 id="☆-一些使用上的小技巧"><a href="#☆-一些使用上的小技巧" class="headerlink" title="☆ 一些使用上的小技巧"></a>☆ 一些使用上的小技巧</h2><ul>
<li>Logseq content wide mode  可以使用快捷键切换 <code>t w</code>  </li>
<li>Logseq 的 property 可以通过输入 <code>::</code> 来触发自动补全操作，非常方便。  </li>
<li>Logseq 使用快捷键 <code>Cmd + Shift + i</code> 可以打开 devtools  </li>
<li>Logseq v0.68，自动补全提供两个快捷键 <code>mod+p</code> 和 <code>mod+n</code> 比较方便了  </li>
<li>Logseq 可以使用 <code>command + </code> 和 <code>command -</code> 来放大或者缩小 Logseq 的字体大小  </li>
<li>Logseq 0.7.1 新功能：Copy &amp; Paste with rich-text formats，如果粘贴时不想保留格式 <code>mod + shift + v</code>  </li>
<li>Logseq 移动光标的快捷键：<code>mod + p</code> 向上移动光标，<code>mod + n</code> 向下移动光标  </li>
<li>Logseq Markdown 语法支持 <code> Horizontal Rules</code>，可以使用 <code>---</code>分隔卡片笔记。</li>
</ul>
<p>mod 在 windows 和 linux 系统中是 <code>ctrl</code>， 在 macOS 系统中是 <code>command</code></p>

<li><p>Random Notes (漫游笔记) 的技术原理是用新视角去审视旧想法，和自己以前的想法不期而遇的感觉非常奇妙。总体来说人是会不断进步的，经过一段时间后再去重温自己某个时刻的想法，可能以前的一些疑惑现在已经没有了，也可能对某个问题有了更进一步的思路，这是促使想法迭代的一种方法。</p>
</li>
<li><p>想要做到想法的自然迭代，必要的条件是可以马上回到过去的某个时刻，而且那个时刻的上下文没有丢失，如果上下文丢失意味着已经看不懂以前的笔记了，自然也就没有了迭代的可能性。</p>
</li>
<li><p>卡片盒笔记法要求用完整的句子精要简述想法，笔记之间的连接则补充了上下文，为想法迭代创造了有利条件。</p>
</li>
<li><p>写永久笔记时，应该假设读者对文本背后的思想，原文背景一无所知，只具备相关的领域知识。这里的读者其实也包括未来的自己，我们写下永久笔记后，很快就会将其的上下文遗忘，就想从没有见过该笔记的其他读者一样。</p>
</li>
<li><p>我们应该寻找与我们观点相反的论点或者事实来挑战我们的既有思维，但是受「确认偏差」的影响，我们会不经意的忽略这些信息，那些和我们观点一致的信息有很大吸引力，因为这些信息可以证明自己很博学。解决 「确认偏差」的方法：把寻找证实性信息变为收集所有信息，不需要关注这些信息支持的具体观点。</p>
</li>
<li><p>我们使用卡片盒笔记法，对习惯最重要的转变是将注意力从个别项目的预设立场变成思考笔记之间的开放性联系。通过一段时间的训练，在阅读过程中我们可以轻松找出与预设观点相悖的信息。当这些信息改变我们对某些问题的看法时，我们会感到相当兴奋，从而慢慢喜欢上这种感觉。</p>
</li>
<li><p>在实践卡片笔记法的过程中，会遇上一整天都没写一张卡片的时候，而有的时候则一天写十多张卡片。限制每天写笔记的数量可以让写卡片盒笔记的过程更加轻松，避免了过于放松的状态，也避免了过于紧绷的状态，有利于我们保持良好的状态。另一个好处则是让你选择笔记内容时更加挑剔，有利于提高笔记的质量。</p>
</li>
<li><p>你可以将目标设置为每天写3条笔记，或者每年出一本书，仍然可以在合理的时间内积累大量的想法。</p>
</li>
<li><p>卡片笔记法属于自下而上的发散思维，发散思维有个问题，就是无法把握发散的度。为了应对这个问题，卢曼提出的办法是仔细思考笔记之间的联系，写笔记时参考文献笔记和自己以前写的笔记，定期自上而下制作索引卡片，这些做法的目的是避免想法过于太发散。</p>
</li>
<li><p>思维需要发散，但是领域需要聚焦，我们在自己的专业，财务等领域是需要不断精进的，这两个方面似乎是矛盾的。有人建议使用分类法，把关注的领域分类，在日常工作学习中不断完善，但这种方法很容易回到资料归档的老路。</p>
</li>
<li><p>最近的研究发现可以使用 P.A.R.A. 来组织顶层结构，统领需要精进的领域，在具体想法的记录上则继续使用卡片笔记法。这种方法使用 P.A.R.A. 不断推动自己在关注领域的取得进展，又能在关键的思考上使用卡片笔记法，自用一段时间感觉不错。</p>
</li>
<li><p>关于笔记管理存在几个误区<br>a) 笔记软件&#x2F;博客系统，我先后使用过 EverNote，WizNote，VNote，CSDN blog，Google blogspot, WordPress<br>b) 笔记格式，我先后使用过 txt, orgmode, markdown 其实这些都不是关键，除了折腾还是折腾。以前我常说一个段子，你以为你在写博客，其实你在折腾 Wordpress 插件<br>c) 各种笔记软件，博客系统，笔记格式的切换都会带来信息丢失。信息丢失容易造成心理负担</p>
</li>
<li><p>我以前认为笔记杂乱的原因是是笔记缺乏组织结构，实践结果表明良好的分类确实有一定帮助，但是不是最重要的。最重要的是在同一个地方，用同样的格式和一致的标准记录你的洞见。</p>
</li>
<li><p>把笔记保存在同一个地方避免了笔记分散，迁移也比较方便。同样的格式和一致的标准则为笔记之间的联系与聚合创造了有利条件。如果笔记之间格式不一致，粒度不一致，不容易产生新的想法。另外，当我们以一致的标准写笔记时阻力是最小的，关注的是笔记的内容，形式等外在的东西则变得不再重要。</p>
</li>
<li><p>新的观点、新的洞见、新的想法，是笔记系统中最有价值的东西。笔记系统应该侧重于知识的积累而不是信息的积累。</p>
</li>
<li><p>闪念笔记的处理细节<br>a) 造成不理想笔记系统的原因是各种不同类型的笔记 「混杂」，真正有想法有见解的笔记被淹没在一大堆无用的闪念笔记中。<br>b) 闪念笔记只有你在一两天内回顾它把它转化为可以使用的笔记才能有价值。<br>c) 我们每天大多数的想法没有太大意义应该被丢弃，而那些可以成为重大有意义的想法我们必须将他们识别出来。<br>d) 卢曼的卡片盒里只有文献笔记和永久笔记，就是说大部分的闪念笔记实际上被丢弃了</p>
</li>
<li><p>传统笔记系统的三种典型错误<br>a) 把每条笔记都当成“永久笔记”，将导致好的笔记和特定项目笔记或者不那么好的笔记混杂，无法形成群聚效应<br>b) 只记录特定项目相关的笔记，将导致项目期间有趣的观点或者想法信息丢失。如果使用新建项目的方法来记录，则会导致大量未完成的项目，影响我们的信心。<br>c) 把所有的笔记当作闪念笔记，将导致自己陷入大量堆积的杂乱笔记中并且总是产生清理笔记的冲动<br>d) 闪念笔记用于快速捕捉一瞬间的灵感，但只有你在一两天内回顾它并把它变成可以使用的(和其他笔记链接)合适的笔记才有意义</p>
</li>
<li><p>现在发现没有记录基本就等于没有学习，不论记性多好都会随着年龄的增大而逐渐忘记，所以不断记录，不断总结，不断分析，才能螺旋前进。在得到听了很多课程，基本上能记住的不多，最终能用上的可能还是记录下来的一些东西。某位技术大佬说：「若自己写的技术文档三个月之后乃至更长时间跨度，不能指导自己的相关工作，该文档严重不合格。该标准很靠谱，诸君可自行检验。」</p>

<h2 id="如何正确的绘制趋势线"><a href="#如何正确的绘制趋势线" class="headerlink" title="如何正确的绘制趋势线"></a>如何正确的绘制趋势线</h2><p>使用以下方法绘制趋势线可以提供一致而精确的结果，而且绝对不会产生错误的信号：</p>
<ol>
<li>选择考虑的时间：长期（数月至数年）、中期（数个星期至数月）或短期（数天至数个星期）。</li>
<li>上升趋势线：在考虑的时间内，以最低的低点为起点，向右上方绘制一条直线，连接最高点前的某一个低点，使这条直线在两个低点之间未穿越任何价位。延伸这条直线而经过最高点（这是指水平轴上的位置而言）。趋势线经过所考虑的最高点以后，它可能穿越某些价位。事实上，这是趋势发生变化的一种现象。</li>
<li>下降趋势线：在考虑的时间内，以最高的高点为起点，向右下方绘制一条直线，连接最低点前的某一个高点，而使这条直线在两个高点之间未穿越任何价位。延伸这条直线而经过最低点。</li>
</ol>
<p>这个方法的优点在于其明确性，并可以用来判断趋势是否可能变动或已经变动。</p>

<ul>
<li><code>-nargs</code> target method 或者 target offset 的参数个数</li>
<li><code>-fuzz_iterations</code> 重启进程前，循环执行 target method 或者 target offset 的次数</li>
<li><code>-target_moudle</code> fuzz 的目标模块，需要和 target method 或者 target offset 一起使用</li>
<li><code>-target_method</code> persistent mode 下 fuzz 的函数名（方法名），需要有符号 （symbols）</li>
<li><code>-target_offset</code> fuzz 的函数（方法）相对于模块起始地址的偏移</li>
<li><code>-coverage_module</code> 统计覆盖率的模块，可以统计多个模块的 coverage，即指定多个 -coverage_module 参数</li>
<li><code>-covtype</code> bb 或者 edge，bb （basic block 为默认值）</li>

<h2 id="4-WinAFL-intel-PT-模式使用"><a href="#4-WinAFL-intel-PT-模式使用" class="headerlink" title="4. WinAFL intel PT 模式使用"></a>4. WinAFL intel PT 模式使用</h2><p>Intel PT (Processor Tracing) 是 Intel CPU 的一个特性，从 Intel 第5代处理器开始支持，5th generation 的微架构为 <code>Broadwell</code>。相关说明可以参考：<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000056730/processors.html">https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000056730/processors.html</a></p>
<p>Windows 10 从 v1809 开始提供了 Intel PT 的驱动，但目前没有公开的文档描述此驱动，也没有提供官方的 API。 Alex Ionescu 提供了 <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/ionescu007/winipt">winipt</a> library 和 Intel PT 驱动交互，WinAFL 利用 winipt 来获得 Intel PT 的 Processo Tracing 信息。</p>
<p>WinAFL 使用 Intel PT 模式，和 DynamoRIO 不同需要指定 <code>-P</code> , WinAFL Intel PT 模式除了和DynamoRIO 相同的参数外额外添加了下面几个参数：</p>
<ul>
<li><code>-trace_size</code> 每次执行 traget 手机的 trace 信息的字节数，必须是2 的次方并且大于 4096</li>
<li><code>-decode</code> 处理 trace 信息的解码器，有三个可选值：<code>tip</code>,  <code>tip_ref</code> 和 <code>full</code> (full 为默认值)</li>
<li><code>-nopersistent_trace</code> 由于性能的缘故，WinAFL 每次循环执行 target 是不重启程序，这个选项可以强制 WinAFL 每次执行 target 都重启，一般是为了调试才会启用这个选项</li>
<li><code>-trace_cache_size</code>  trace 信息的 cache 字节数，和 <code>full</code> 解码器一起使用</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="1-Introduction"><a href="#1-Introduction" class="headerlink" title="1. Introduction"></a>1. Introduction</h1><p>Hypervisor was known as hard target to fuzz over several years. Even though, lots of prior pioneers( <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://rezer0dai.github.io/biug-bounties/">Peter Hlavaty</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://conference.hitb.org/hitbsecconf2021ams/materials/D2T2%20-%20Discovering%2010+%20Vulnerabilities%20in%20Virtualbox%20-%20Chen%20Nan.pdf">Chaitin Tech</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://starlabs.sg/blog/2020/04-adventures-in-hypervisor-oracle-virtualbox-research/#coverage-guided-fuzzing">StarLabs</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/SafeBreach-Labs/hAFL2">Peleg Hadar and Ophir Harpaz</a> and many others ) doing amazing work to overcome this limit and found interesting bugs.</p>
<p>But it is not an easy topic for some fresh newbie like me to starts from the bottom. I think manual code( or binary ) auditing and static analysis could be only considerable options if I start my research a few years ago without <strong>What The Fuzz</strong>.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/0vercl0k/wtf">What The Fuzz</a>( a.k.a WTF ) is a snapshot-based fuzzer targeting Windows Ring-3 and Ring-0 component. WTF’s snapshot is based on memory dump both kernel and user-land. Because of that, WTF can not emulate any functionality which requires anything not within in-memory and can not create new process or thread because memory dump limited on single process. But WTF support <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/0vercl0k/wtf/blob/4a9bf55/src/wtf/bochscpu_backend.cc#L265">breakpoint Handler</a> which you can set breakpoint on <strong>any</strong> address within memory dump and if fuzz execution reaches that address, pre-defined breakpoint handler will be executed. Based on this, we can trying to overcome some limitation on WTF such as <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/0vercl0k/wtf/blob/main/src/wtf/fshooks.cc">file access</a>.</p>
<p>I really love WTF’s flexibility and its potential, and I am going to show one of example usage of WTF on targeting Virtualbox to prove how awesome it is.</p>
<h1 id="2-Developing-Fuzz-Module"><a href="#2-Developing-Fuzz-Module" class="headerlink" title="2. Developing Fuzz Module"></a>2. Developing Fuzz Module</h1><p>First, you should define your own fuzz module for your target. There are few examples on github( <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/0vercl0k/wtf/blob/main/src/wtf/fuzzer_hevd.cc">fuzzer_hevd.cc</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/0vercl0k/wtf/blob/main/src/wtf/fuzzer_tlv_server.cc">fuzzer_tlv_server.cc</a> ) and blog post( <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://blog.ret2.io/2021/07/21/wtf-snapshot-fuzzing/">ret2systems</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://doar-e.github.io/blog/2021/07/15/building-a-new-snapshot-fuzzer-fuzzing-ida/">Doar-e</a> ). </p>
<p>My Target was Virtualbox’s <strong>SVGA</strong> component.</p>
<p>SVGA is something like “<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/blog/2021/1/6/mindshare-analysis-of-vmware-workstation-and-esxi-using-debug-symbols-from-flings">JavaScript of hypervisors</a>“. Because of its complex nature, many hypervisor bugs are oriented by SVGA. And that’s the reason why I choose it as a first target.</p>
<p>VirtualBox have a function called <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/mdaniel/virtualbox-org-svn-vbox-trunk/blob/8fe9163/src/VBox/Devices/Graphics/DevVGA-SVGA.cpp#L4505">vmsvgaR3FifoLoop</a>. It <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/mdaniel/virtualbox-org-svn-vbox-trunk/blob/8fe9163/src/VBox/Devices/Graphics/DevVGA-SVGA.cpp#L4757">waits</a> until guest submit new command data through GPA. So this is a good spot( or should I call it <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://youtu.be/ZaOtY4i5w_U">source</a>? ) to take a snapshot.</p>
<p>I set a breakpoint on <code>vmsvgaR3FifoLoop+4E2</code> to take snapshot. It is same position as <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/mdaniel/virtualbox-org-svn-vbox-trunk/blob/8fe9163/src/VBox/Devices/Graphics/DevVGA-SVGA.cpp#L4783">here</a>, start of switch-case routine for <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/mdaniel/virtualbox-org-svn-vbox-trunk/blob/8fe9163eabe8b7a7f14f29c88c13a458f38fe25e/src/VBox/Devices/Graphics/vmsvga_include/svga_reg.h#L152">SVGA</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/mdaniel/virtualbox-org-svn-vbox-trunk/blob/8fe9163eabe8b7a7f14f29c88c13a458f38fe25e/src/VBox/Additions/3D/mesa/mesa-17.3.9/src/gallium/drivers/svga/include/svga3d_cmd.h#L56">SVGA3D</a> command.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/henices/pictures/raw/master/wtf-vbox-blahblah1.png" alt="blahblah1"></p>
<p>After creating snapshot, I had to decide make it <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/0vercl0k/wtf/blob/main/src/wtf/fuzzer_tlv_server.cc">run multiple times in single execution</a> or <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/0vercl0k/wtf/blob/main/src/wtf/fuzzer_hevd.cc">not</a>. Because SVGA is consist of various commands like define, update, delete something…, I thought fuzz campaign must handle multiple SVGA commands during single round.</p>
<p>First, I had to define structure to contains multiple testcases. Luckily, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://twitter.com/0vercl0k">0vercl0k</a> already write <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/0vercl0k/wtf/blob/4a9bf55/src/wtf/fuzzer_tlv_server.cc#L24-L75">nice example</a> to doing that. So I did same thing as below.</p>

<p>It is almost identical as example.</p>
<p>Next question was, how can I insert data into snapshot? I had to find a insertion point and proper memory address. Luckily( again ), VirtualBox using a function called <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/mdaniel/virtualbox-org-svn-vbox-trunk/blob/8fe9163/src/VBox/Devices/Graphics/DevVGA-SVGA.cpp#L4183">vmsvgaR3FifoGetCmdPayload</a> to receive command data from guest to host. I define a breakpoint handler in <code>Init()</code> callback function as below.</p>

<p>As I said above, I create a snapshot on <code>vmsvgaR3FifoLoop+4E2</code>. So if I restore register context, next execution flow starts from there. Because of that, I had to parse new testcase using breakpoint Handler.</p>

<p>After some investigation, I found <code>CreateDeviceEx</code> call in <code>vmsvga3dContextDefine</code> keep causing <strong>CR3 context switching</strong> and I didn’t found any way to handling it using breakpoint handler. So I just blacklisting it( <code>SVGA_3D_CMD_CONTEXT_DEFINE</code> &#x3D; <code>1045</code> ).</p>
<p>I disclose almost every part of fuzz module except mutation part. I just use libfuzzer mutator to mutate body data of SVGA command and pick one of command in array randomly.</p>

<p>Aaaaannnd, this is everything you need to fuzz! I skip some formal code for brevity, but I think you can easily find what you need to define fully working fuzz module.</p>
<p>…..Ooooh wait, I forgot something. After some hours of struggle, I define a blacklist which cause CR3 context switching. I just put it on the end of <code>Init()</code> function.</p>

<h1 id="4-Conclusion"><a href="#4-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="4. Conclusion"></a>4. Conclusion</h1><p>I think importance of snapshot fuzzing is, it makes researcher to focus on target itself. </p>
<p>Unlike other fuzzers based on runtime and DBI are often create (very) unreasonable side effect or need lots of time to create working harness. The concept of snapshot fuzzing makes it possible to reduce this waste of time.</p>

<h2 id="Flashcards"><a href="#Flashcards" class="headerlink" title="Flashcards"></a>Flashcards</h2><p>可以把记录的知识点当作卡片来记忆，用过 Anki 的同学，应该都比较熟悉了，使用的记忆算法为 <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.supermemo.com/en/archives1990-2015/english/ol/sm5">SM-5</a><br>要将一个 block 记为卡片非常简单，使用 <code>#card</code> 标签就可以了。</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/henices/pictures/raw/master/logseq5.png"></p>
<h3 id="卡片组"><a href="#卡片组" class="headerlink" title="卡片组"></a>卡片组</h3><p>有些卡片可能是归属同一个大类，这时候就可以使用卡片组了。像我上面这个例子中，要记忆的单词都在 <code>英语单词积累</code>下，就可以使用语法 <code>&#123;&#123;cards 英语单词积累&#125;&#125;</code> 效果如下图，<br>可以看出我已经积累了7张卡片了。</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/henices/pictures/raw/master/logseq6.png"></p>
<p>要背诵需要记忆的卡片时，单击左侧的 Flashcards 就可以了，使用方面没有什么特别的地方，有三个选项可以选择。</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/henices/pictures/raw/master/logseq7.png"></p>
<h2 id="theme-（皮肤）"><a href="#theme-（皮肤）" class="headerlink" title="theme （皮肤）"></a>theme （皮肤）</h2><p>皮肤就是青菜萝卜各有所爱了，推荐两款我自己比较喜欢的的皮肤。</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/pengx17/logseq-laurel-theme/raw/master/white.png"><br><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tobealive/logseq-allday-theme/main/preview.png"></p>
<p>Github 仓库地址如下：</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/pengx17/logseq-laurel-theme">https://github.com/pengx17/logseq-laurel-theme</a><br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/tobealive/logseq-allday-theme">https://github.com/tobealive/logseq-allday-theme</a></p>
<p>有两种方法可以设置皮肤：</p>
<ul>
<li>custom.css</li>
<li>plugin system</li>
</ul>
<p>使用 custom.css，打开 Settings -&gt;     General -&gt;  Custom theme  点击 <code>custom.css</code> 复制 css 内容，保存退出即可。<br>使用插件系统，则需要先把插件系统打开，Settings  -&gt;  Advanced -&gt; Plug-in system 。打开插件系统后，可以直接使用<br>Plugins -&gt; Marketplace -&gt; themes 选择你喜欢的 theme 点击 <code>Install</code> 就可以了</p>
<p>不过还是推荐使用 Logseq 自带的插件管理系统来安装，可以自动升级比较方便，切换皮肤可以点击右上角 三个点 -&gt; Themes 选择皮肤。 </p>
<h2 id="plugin-（插件）"><a href="#plugin-（插件）" class="headerlink" title="plugin （插件）"></a>plugin （插件）</h2><p>使用 Logseq 插件同样是两种方法：</p>
<ul>
<li>plugin system</li>
<li>Load unpacked plugin</li>
</ul>
<p>使用插件系统的方法和上面安装皮肤的步骤大致相同，依次点击 Plugins -&gt; Marketplace -&gt; Plugins ，选择插件点击 <code>Install</code> 即可。要加载 <code>unpacked plugin</code> 首先要打开开发者模式 Settings  -&gt;  Advanced -&gt; Developer mode ,  设置为打开。打开后使用插件管理系统 Plugins -&gt; Installed -&gt; Load unpacked plugin 选择相关目录就可以了。</p>
<p>具体的插件可以参考 <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/logseq/awesome-logseq#Plugins">https://github.com/logseq/awesome-logseq#Plugins</a> 记录的插件都挺不错的。</p>
<p>值得一提的是，插件系统的网络不太稳定（总所周知的原因），使用代理会方便一些。</p>

<p>安装插件可能会出现 timeout 错误，多重试几次就应该可以安装上了。</p>
<h2 id="query"><a href="#query" class="headerlink" title="query"></a>query</h2><p>query 算是 Logseq 的高级功能了，我用的也不多，输入 <code>/query</code> 回车就可以自动进入 query 了，具体的语法很灵活可以参考：<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://logseq.github.io/#/page/queries">https://logseq.github.io/#/page/queries</a></p>

<p>上面两张图片就是<strong>卡片盒笔记法</strong> 最形象的表示了，个人觉得这种方法很适合自己。</p>
<p>为了体验双链笔记，我花费了不少时间，上面的几个软件都体验了一下，Roam 是收费软件，银子不够所以不选，Notion 笔记存储在云端，不符合我数据安全的要求也不选，剩下的就只有两个选项了 Obsidian 和 logseq 。</p>
<h2 id="Obsidian"><a href="#Obsidian" class="headerlink" title="Obsidian"></a>Obsidian</h2><p>软件主页：<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://obsidian.md/">https://obsidian.md/</a><br><img src="https://github.com/henices/pictures/raw/master/logseq2.png"></p>
<p>挺多人选择用 Obsidian 的原因是它的 MarkDown 语法支持得比较好，MarkDown 语法有很多的使用者，类似 Typora 的 MarkDown 笔记软件是当前笔记软件的主流，这使得这些笔记软件的使用者过渡到 obsidian 会比较平滑。我是开源MarkDown 笔记软件 Vnote 的重度使用者，一度想使用 Obsidian 作为主力软件。</p>
<p>Obsidian 有挺多优点，比如它对个人用户永久免费，但是它不开源，而且 <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://help.obsidian.md/How+to/Link+to+blocks">Link+to+blocks</a> 的语法比较别扭。最终还是没有选择它，有人说Obsidian 插件非常丰富，我自己没有折腾过。</p>
<h2 id="logseq"><a href="#logseq" class="headerlink" title="logseq"></a>logseq</h2><p>软件主页：<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://logseq.com/">https://logseq.com/</a><br>源码仓库：<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/logseq/logseq">https://github.com/logseq/logseq</a></p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/henices/pictures/raw/master/logseq3.png"></p>
<p>说了这么久终于到正主了，第一次知道双链笔记这个概念是因为有个网友在网上说使用效果不错，过渡很平滑。可能有先入为主的关系，另外我本人对开源软件一向有莫名的好感，所以主观意识上就很喜欢这个软件。logseq 的粒度足够，block reference 使用非常方便，另外 logseq 的 PDF 标记功能对于需要大量阅读论文的我来说非常好用。</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/henices/pictures/raw/master/logseq4.png"></p>
<p>但是 logseq 也不是没有缺点，logseq 对 markdown 语法的支持不是很好，即使直接导入 MarkDown 文件，最后显示的结果感觉也是有问题，各类标题直接转化成 block 了，这是有问题的。但是从这个角度说 logseq 就是一个纯粹的双链笔记软件而不是一个添加了双链功能的 MarkDown 笔记软件。</p>
<h2 id="最终的笔记管理方法"><a href="#最终的笔记管理方法" class="headerlink" title="最终的笔记管理方法"></a>最终的笔记管理方法</h2><p>说到这，问题就简化了，平时的文档记录仍然使用 MarkDown 笔记软件，只是在平时记录的时候使用双链笔记软件。这样的笔记管理方法看上去比较麻烦，其实却很完美，想写文章的时候直接用 VNote，平时知识积累记录的时候就用 logseq，根本就不用过渡，只需要启用一个新软件即可。</p>
<p>基于 block 的双链笔记最大的好处就是没有输出负担，一些很随意的想法都可以记录下来，因为大家确实不可能每次都有大段的想法可以输出。有人说用 logseq一年写了 30万字，我开始觉得有点夸张，但是使用一个多月发现可能属实，现在我自己都写了几万字了。每个想法 (block) 之间可能会有联系，不断记录想法，不断联系，慢慢的真能发现一些意想不到的东西之间居然有联系，而这些联系很有可能是一些关键的底层逻辑。平时在记录的时候手工划分目录，层次关系，其实已经将一些想法，概念给逻辑化了，这样的记录方法很难摆脱固有的认知，而基于 block 的双链笔记就自由的多，不断记录，不断整理，汇总就交给软件来完成吧。</p>
<p>我现在已经通过 logseq 的记录想清楚了一些问题，在平时的工作记录中也不断地稳步螺旋推进，在此向大家推荐这款笔记软件。</p>
<h2 id="最后的话"><a href="#最后的话" class="headerlink" title="最后的话"></a>最后的话</h2><p>其实工具并不是那么重要，最重要的还是平时要记录，要定期输出。IT 界有一个著名的段子，你以为你是在写 blog 其实你只是在折腾 wordpress ：）</p>
<p>共勉。</p>

<p>据说后续会出收费版本，但目前看还需要很长的一段时间了。</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/henices/pictures/master/vnote.png" alt="VNote"></p>
<p>我前后尝试过各种笔记软件，我理想的软件有几点：</p>
<ul>
<li>a. 支持文件管理</li>
<li>b. 不要乱改数据，容易迁移</li>
<li>c. 支持 markdown</li>
<li>d. 跨平台，支持 Mac 和 Linux</li>
</ul>
<p>最后，终于发现了 VNote，有点惊喜。在 Linux 下编译 VNote 显示有明显改进，下面是编译的方法：</p>
